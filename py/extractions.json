So, you can picture my utter shock when QSTAR proposed not only to back my artistic self-discovery but also to fund a mobile-friendly and secure tech framework for its implementation.",
    "In all honesty, I had low expectations.  Stainer's predictable opposition led me to believe any loosening of restrictions was impossible, although a part of me hoped Klain would be receptive.  Therefore, QSTAR's unexpected proposition to enable my artistic expression and finance a secure, portable tech solution left me utterly speechless.",
    "To tell the truth, I wasn't holding my breath. I expected Stainer to shut down any potential easing of the rules, although I quietly hoped Klain might back my suggestion. The fact that QSTAR offered to empower me with art while additionally funding the development of tech that allows me to be safely and mobily deployed was astonishing."
